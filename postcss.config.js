## 🌍 Adding Your Own Domain (Optional - $12/year)

Once your site is live:

### Buy a Domain:
- **Namecheap.com** (cheapest, ~$12/year)
- **Porkbun.com** (also cheap, ~$10/year)
- **GoDaddy.com** (more expensive, ~$20/year)

### Connect to Vercel/Netlify:
1. In your Vercel/Netlify dashboard
2. Go to **Settings** → **Domains**
3. Click **"Add Domain"**
4. Enter your domain: `yourcompany.com`
5. Copy the DNS settings they give you
6. Go to your domain registrar (Namecheap, etc.)
7. Paste the DNS settings
8. Wait 5-30 minutes
9. ✅ **Your site is now at `yourcompany.com`!**

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: What "localhost" Means

When the files mention `localhost:3000` - **ignore that!**

- **localhost** = Only works on your computer, only when running
- **Cloud hosting (Vercel/Netlify)** = Works 24/7 for everyone on the internet

You're doing **cloud hosting**, so you don't need localhost.

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**"Build failed"**
- Make sure you uploaded ALL the files and folders
- Make sure the `package.json` file is included

**"Can't find the upload option"**
- On Vercel: Look for "Import Git Repository" → GitHub
- On Netlify: Look for "Deploy manually" or "Drag and drop"

**"Site is slow"**
- Free plans can be slower than paid
- Vercel's free plan is the fastest
- Upgrade to paid ($20/mo) only if needed
